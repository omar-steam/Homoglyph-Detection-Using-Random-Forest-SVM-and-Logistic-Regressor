# Homoglyph-Detection-Using-Random-Forest-SVM-and-Logistic-Regressor
Homoglyphs are characters that appear visually similar but have different Unicode code points. They're commonly used in phishing attacks to create deceptive domain names or text that looks legitimate but isn't. For example, using Cyrillic 'о' (U+043E) instead of Latin 'o' (U+006F) in "password" → "passwоrd".
